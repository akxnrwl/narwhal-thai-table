/**
 * Multi-language "Coming Soon" ticker pinned to the very top of every page.
 *
 * Why a ticker: the giant Hero watermark looked rough on mobile (font scaled
 * down too aggressively and competed with the H1 for attention). A slim
 * top bar that runs through 8 languages serves the same "we are opening
 * soon" message but is immediately visible on first paint at any screen
 * size — which matters because Huntington Beach has a multilingual
 * customer base (Thai, Spanish, Vietnamese, Chinese, Korean, Filipino,
 * Japanese, English).
 *
 * The languages are repeated twice in the track so the CSS keyframe can
 * translate the inner element by exactly -50% and loop seamlessly. Only
 * the FIRST set carries semantic meaning (read by screen readers); the
 * duplicate is aria-hidden so it isn't announced twice.
 *
 * Animation respects prefers-reduced-motion (set in globals.css) by
 * stopping the scroll and showing the first phrase only.
